# Suppliers
In the Bill of Materials, I sometimes list McMaster as the supplier.  You do not have to purchase the components from McMaster.  McMaster provides excellent specifications for all of their components.  McMaster links are an easy way to access specifications.

When McMaster does not supply a specific part, I've included links to suppliers I've used.  These parts will fulfill the requirements of this design, but you may select equivalent parts.
# Materials
## 3D Printer Filament
As I built my project carts, I selected ASA as the filament.  You may substitute the material of your choice.  Just ensure you understand the material properties meet your load requirements.
## Fasteners
I've specified stainless steel fasteners.  You may choose any material you wish for your fasteners as long as you weigh the material change against your load requirements.
## Plywood
I've chosen MDF and Baltic Birch for the plywood portion of the cart.  I've tested these materials to ensure they meet my load requirements.  Avoid using thin MDF or particleboard for the interior shelves.  It is not strong enough for even the smallest loads.  If you use MDF, it should be a much thicker size, and the Hudson Exchange straight wall containers will no longer fit between the shelves.
# Standards
All fasteners I've used in my testing conform to ISO 4762.
